### **Frontend**

1. **Framework**: **Next & React** - Known for its flexibility and wide range of libraries, React works well with dynamic UIs and can be styled easily with tools like Tailwind CSS.
2. **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** - Provides a responsive, utility-first approach to styling, which can streamline the development of consistent and visually clean interfaces.
3. **State Management**: **Redux**  - Choose Redux for global state management in complex applications
4. **Wallet Integration**: **web3.js** (for EVM) and **@solana/web3.js** (for Solana) - These libraries allow users to connect to blockchain wallets (e.g., MetaMask for EVM, Phantom for Solana).

### **Backend**

1. **Server Framework**: **Node.js with Express** - A lightweight, scalable choice for handling RESTful API requests, managing bot strategies, and orchestrating backend processes.
2. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - **Ethers.js** - For interacting with EVM-compatible blockchains and smart contracts.
   - **@solana/web3.js** - To communicate with Solana’s blockchain.
3. **Real-time Data**: **WebSockets** - Useful for real-time price and order book data, allowing your app to respond quickly to market conditions.
4. **Task Scheduling**: **Bull or Agenda** - For managing bot execution tasks, especially when scheduling trades and monitoring conditions.
5. **Hosting**: **AWS (Lambda, EC2)** or **DigitalOcean** - Both platforms offer scalable and cost-effective solutions for backend hosting, with AWS providing serverless options for cost efficiency.

### **Database**

1. **User and Bot Configuration Storage**:
   - **Supabase** - Great for user management, authentication, and real-time database needs.
   - Alternatively, **PostgreSQL** for a robust relational database if you need complex queries or self-hosted control.
2. **Bot Execution Logs**: **MongoDB** - Useful for storing bot history and execution data with a flexible, document-oriented structure.

### **Smart Contracts**

1. **EVM (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, etc.)**:
   - **Solidity** - The main language for developing contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains.
   - **Hardhat** - A versatile framework for testing, deploying, and debugging smart contracts.
2. **Solana**:
   - **Rust** - The primary language for Solana’s high-performance smart contracts.
   - **Anchor Framework** - Simplifies development on Solana, adding support for program tests and deploying on-chain.

### **Data and Oracle Services**

1. **Chainlink** - To access reliable, decentralized oracles for real-time data on EVM-compatible chains.
2. **Pyth Network** - A popular option on Solana for real-time pricing and market data.

### **Development and Testing Tools**

1. **Version Control**: **Git with GitHub or GitLab** - Essential for code management and collaboration.
2. **CI/CD**: **GitHub Actions** or **CircleCI** - Automates testing, building, and deploying your app.
3. **Testing**:
   - **Jest** - For unit and integration tests in frontend and backend code.
   - **Mocha + Chai** - Useful for testing smart contracts.
   - **Hardhat Testing Environment** (for EVM) and **Anchor** (for Solana) - Essential for end-to-end blockchain testing.

### **Monitoring and Analytics**

1. **Application Performance Monitoring**: **Datadog** or **New Relic** - Tracks app performance and error logs.
2. **Logging**: **Winston** or **Morgan** for backend logging, helping you track and troubleshoot bot activities and errors.
3. **Frontend Analytics**: **Mixpanel** or **Google Analytics** - Tracks user behavior, feature usage, and funnel analysis.
