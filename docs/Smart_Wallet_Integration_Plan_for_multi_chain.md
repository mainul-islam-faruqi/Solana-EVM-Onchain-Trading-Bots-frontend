For implementing **smart wallets** in a multi-chain setup (EVM and Solana), here’s a step-by-step plan. This will outline both the setup and functionality needed for smart contract wallets on both chains, focusing on security, interoperability, and user experience.

---

### **Smart Wallet Integration Plan for Multi-Chain**

#### **1. Define Smart Wallet Requirements**
   - **Multisig & Access Control**: Determine if you want multi-signature functionality or specific access control features, as these will affect the design.
   - **Transaction Management**: Define transaction signing, gas management, and relayer support for gasless transactions (optional).
   - **Interoperability**: Ensure the smart wallet’s core functionalities are compatible with EVM and Solana.

#### **2. EVM Smart Wallet Setup (Using Rainbowkit)**

   1. **Choose Smart Wallet Framework**:
      - Use **Gnosis Safe** or **Argent** (popular smart wallet frameworks) or deploy a custom smart wallet contract if specific functionality is required.
      - Ensure compatibility with **Rainbowkit** for connection and transaction handling.

   2. **Contract Deployment and Testing**:
      - Write the wallet contract in Solidity. Implement core functionalities like multi-signature, custom transaction fees, and optional gas relayer support.
      - Deploy the smart wallet contract on EVM testnets (Rinkeby, Goerli) for initial testing.
   
   3. **Backend Logic for Transaction Management**:
      - Use **ethers.js** with Rainbowkit to handle user connections, execute transactions, and interact with the smart wallet’s functions (e.g., sending tokens or transferring assets).
      - For gasless transactions, integrate with a **gas relayer** service or contract to cover transaction fees.

   4. **User Interface (UI) Modifications**:
      - Update the UI to support multi-signature flows, transaction approvals, and custom settings specific to smart wallets.
      - Ensure Rainbowkit’s wallet UI reflects smart wallet connections and supports the smart wallet’s interaction flow.

#### **3. Solana Smart Wallet Setup (Using SPL Token and Wallet Programs)**

   1. **Design a Solana Program for Smart Wallet**:
      - Develop a **Solana Program** in Rust that supports core wallet functionalities like multi-signature, token transfers, and custom access control if needed.
      - Integrate **SPL Token Program** functionalities to allow token transfers, balance checks, and minting (if needed).

   2. **Deploy and Test the Smart Wallet Program**:
      - Deploy the smart wallet program on Solana’s testnet. Test token transfers, multi-signature, and transaction approvals within the program.
   
   3. **Frontend Integration with `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`**:
      - Use the `@solana/wallet-adapter` to enable interactions between user wallets and the smart wallet program.
      - Implement Solana-specific wallet functions, such as sending tokens, approving transactions, and viewing balances, through the adapter.

   4. **Data Fetching and Updates**:
      - Use **@solana/web3.js** to fetch program data and update the UI, showing wallet balances, transaction history, and bot states.
      - Implement real-time updates if the program includes frequent interactions or triggers.

---

#### **4. Cross-Chain Considerations**
   - **Data Consistency**: For a consistent user experience, ensure both EVM and Solana wallet UIs follow similar workflows and update in real-time.
   - **Transaction History**: Design a unified dashboard showing transaction history and balances across both chains.
   - **Security**: Conduct smart contract audits on both chains. Implement access control and multi-signature to prevent unauthorized actions.

---

#### **5. Testing and Validation**
   - **Cross-Chain Testing**: Test interactions on both EVM and Solana testnets, ensuring that smart wallet functions work consistently and without errors.
   - **User Flow Testing**: Verify that users can seamlessly switch between EOAs and smart wallets.
   - **Security Testing**: Conduct security checks for the smart wallet programs on both chains to handle malicious activity and prevent unauthorized access.
